However, it's important to note that these results are intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered a definitive medical diagnosis.\n" +

This step is entirely optional, and users must explicitly choose to share their data for this purpose. If selected, only the original image, not the analysis results, are sent to these external services.\n" +

This process also gathers vital contextual information, often necessary for a more comprehensive health assessment. Additionally, it educates users about the symptoms associated with the detected condition, enabling more informed decisions about seeking professional medical advice.\n" +
